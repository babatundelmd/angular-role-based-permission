## Angular Role Based Permission

A brief description - In this project, I have gone ahead to demonstrate/implement how a User with Role(s)/Permission(s) will be able to view specific components.

The Manager who is the SuperAdmin can view `All Regions` on the Sidebar Menu and also has the permission to view `Total Revenue` on the dashboard.

The Regional Manager and the City Manager don't have access to `All Regions` on the Sidebar Menu and `Total Revenue` on the dashboard.

`Note:` This is just for demonstration purposes.
